 command line payment application
The Command-Line Payment Application is a Java-based application that facilitates financial transactions through a command-line interface. It allows users to register, log in, update their profiles, send money to other users or bank accounts, make payments, refund transactions, and view their transaction history. The application uses MySQL as the backend database and JDBC for database connectivity.
